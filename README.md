## Mini-Max Sum
The time complexity is O(n) because it loops through the input array once, performing constant work each step.\
The space complexity is O(n) because the input space complexity is O(n) and the auxiliary space complexity is O(1).

## Weighted Uniform String
The time complexity is O(n) because it iterates the input string once.
The space complexity is O(n^2) because it has an input space complexity of O(n) and an auxiliary space complexity of O(n^2).
